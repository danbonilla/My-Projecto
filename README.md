Projecto
===========

### Overview

**Projecto** is a bilingual estimating tool for small home improvement projects. It's goal is to simplify the material calculating process for projects such as drywall installation and flooring installations. It will guide user in the measuring process, and allow user to just plug in measurements, and get and estimate for quantity of materials needed, and estimated cost. Hoping to be able to help out those that can perform the labor, but struggle in the estimating and budgeting areas.
